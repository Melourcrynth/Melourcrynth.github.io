                    <h1>A Guide to Artwork Commission Communication</h1>
<p>I regularly hear of both artists and customers complain about communication issues with artwork commissions. The colors came out wrong despite being clearly shown in the reference. The customer didn't describe things properly and then demanded changes after spending 12 hours on the picture. They drew the wrong thing. They didn't tell me what to draw.</p>
<p>These aren't problems I run into and I hope that this document can be of some help for people that do.</p>
<p>Drawing is more of a hobby of mine, my day job is software development. A lot of the skills and concepts making software for people translates to making art for people: you're asked to produce something from someone who isn't necessarily technical/artistic and the further you get with developing/drawing it, the harder it gets to respond to requests for changes when the result inevitably isn't what the customer wanted.</p>
<p>In software development, people have figured out ways to solve this. Not by making change requests go away, but by changing their processes to welcome changes. These ideas can be applied to artwork commissions as well, in my opinion very easily. The broad idea is to disconnect yourself from the notion of the customer putting in a request and then art falling out - instead, it's an iterative process of taking small steps and getting feedback to keep changes small.</p>
<p>The more detailed ideas are written up as ten points below. The target audience is people drawing individualized pictures and getting paid for it. "You" are the artist. "The customer" is the person asking for the commission.</p>
<p>If you're doing stuff like mass-produced YCHs or wing-it commissions or something in that vein, these points probably don't apply to you. If you don't have any of the initially mentioned problems, then you probably also don't need this. If you're writing stories, some parts may still be useful, but stories are much more malleable, so changes aren't as painful to begin with.</p>
<p>This is not gospel, I'm just a fool on the internet thinking that this stuff might help someone. Feedback is welcomed if you know how to contact me.</p>
<h2>1. The customer doesn't know what they want.</h2>
<p>And it's <em>your</em> job to figure it out with them. You're paid to produce something for the customer, so it's your responsibility to know what that is.</p>
<p>Pull in the info you need. Ask them to do a scribble in Paint or on the back of a napkin. If something is missing or imprecise, turn it into something concrete.</p>
<p>Note that the customer probably <em>can't</em> know what they want. They may not have experience in art or writing a specification. Trying to build an all-encompassing request form or plastering warnings about giving you "all the details" is wasted effort. Just do the legwork, for the sake of your and your customers' sanity.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"What should the expression be?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"How big should they be?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"What should their arms be doing?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. "Artistic license" is just imprecision.</h2>
<p>It's the customer's job to make the final call on what they want. You don't want that responsibility.</p>
<p>When the customer doesn't specify something, offer them ideas and call in confirmation. Don't work towards an incomplete description.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"How about the background being a mountain camp with tents around?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I could draw the character sitting up or laying back. Which one do you prefer?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I'll sketch a few expressions and you can pick which one you like best."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. When the customer says "jump", you ask "how high?"</h2>
<p>This goes for many descriptions of sizes and scales. "Really big" is meaningless, "the size of a car" is something you can draw.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"He should be huge." - "How huge, like the size of a skyscraper?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"They should be in a tiny tent." - "So tiny that they have to squeeze together or enough room for both of them?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Could you make it bigger?" - "How much bigger, like twice the size?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Communicate your understanding.</h2>
<p>Describing a picture with words is pretty hard, misunderstandings can happen easily. Once you think you have a complete understanding of something, tell the customer what it is that you understood and have them check if there's something missing or wrong. If disputes arise later, you can point back at this confirmation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"In summary: it's a flat colored picture with one character and a background for $69.69. It should feature Glychthrax laying in a hammock on the beach, each of his tentacles holding a different-colored tropical drink with funny straws coming out of it, sipping on one of them. At the edge of the picture there's a scantily-clad waitress bringing more drinks on a tray. Did I understand that correctly or is there anything wrong or missing?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So the tongue should have alternating green and purple spots with a spiraling red line all around it like a barber pole?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Make changes painless.</h2>
<p>Work in iterative steps and ask about changes at each one. It's a pain to change something on a finished piece, but cheap to twiddle a few lines in a sketch.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Here's a sketch. How is that?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Colored the fur patterns. Did I get those right?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Call in change requests.</h2>
<p>Explicitly ask for changes at each step. The customer is responsible for confirming you can proceed. If they change their mind later, you can point back at this.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Is this what you had in mind or is there anything that should be changed?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Anything that should be changed, added or removed on it?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Show the limits of change requests.</h2>
<p>Explain that it may become impossible to change things as the picture proceeds further. If they ask for the impossibility anyway, point back at this.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"It might not be possible to change stuff on the lines once I start adding colors."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I can't change that anymore, that's something that would have needed to be fixed in the sketch."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. The customer doesn't know your process.</h2>
<p>Explain yourself. Let them know what you're doing and what is left to do.</p>
<p>Especially keep this in mind when you're asked "dumb" questions that appear obvious to you.</p>
<p>Don't get impatient about the customer asking about things that don't pertain to the current step in the process. It's better than being told "oh, I didn't mention it earlier because I thought you were going to do it anyway."</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"I will draw a sketch to see if it matches what you want."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Here is the flat colors. It's still missing shading and effects."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yes, the roughness is because it's a sketch, it'll be drawn over with clean lines."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. The customer is fallible.</h2>
<p>Forgetting, misunderstanding and making mistakes is human. Be prepared for change requests that aren't your fault.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Oh, the reference has the paws colored wrong."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I meant he's supposed to be sitting cross-legged, not kneeling."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. Be professional.</h2>
<p>You're providing a service, act like it. Be nice, don't scold, yell at or talk smack about your customers. Be patient, answer questions even if you already answered them in a document that the customer should have read.</p>
<p>If you keep running into the same problems, fix the cause on your end.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your terms of service are frequently misunderstood, write clearer ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you know people don't read your important document properly, tell them the most important information again manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a customer is clearly unreasonable, don't fight, just cancel their order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
