<p>Prices are listed in Euros (€)!</p>
<p>Payment via Paypal after completion. How much it'll cost will be fully discussed beforehand of course. The invoice will be in Euros, but we can pin the price to your local currency so that exchange rates don't make it fluctuate after the fact.</p>
<p>After paying, you will be given all the rights to share, use, modify, sell and do whatever else you want with the work. You can color sketches, rewrite stories, sell paintings printed on a shirt or whatever else you want.</p>
<p>You'll get lots of work in progress updates along the way so that any mistakes can be spotted and fixed as early as possible.</p>
<p>The commission queue is <a href="queue">here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Pictures</h2>

<dt>Add a Vignette</dt>
<dd>You can also get a short story along with your picture. 1000 words max at 20% off the regular word price listed below.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Background prices depend a lot on complexity. A plain space backdrop is usually free, a fully detailed city probably costs full price.</p>
<p>I don't offer flat-colored pictures myself, but I know people who will color sketches as a commission. Ask about it.</p>
<p>Alternate versions ("alts") can often be added without any additional cost. A series of pictures can sometimes re-use stuff, e.g. if they use the same background you only pay for it once.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Stories</h2>

<p>The price is 0.01€ (one cent) per word.</p>
<p>You decide a maximum word count for your story and only have to pay to that number of words at most.</p>
<p>For example: if you ask for a story with a maximum of 2000 words but I write 3000 words, you pay only €20.00. If I only write 1500 words, then you pay €15.00.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Animations</h2>

<p>Price depends on complexity, but probably a couple hundred Euros and up. Ask about it and we can figure it out in detail.</p>
<p>These are <em>very</em> limited in availability, animation takes a lot of time.</p>
