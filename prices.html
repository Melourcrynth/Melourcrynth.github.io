<p>Prices are listed in Euros (€)! You can pay with any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SEPA transfer, the "normal" bank transfer in the EU, UK, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via credit or debit card through Stripe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PayPal. (Comes with high transfer fees, so the other options are preferred.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment happens after completion. How much it'll cost will be fully discussed beforehand of course. The invoice will be in Euros, but we can put down the price in your local currency so that exchange rates don't make the price fluctuate - ask about it.</p>
<p>After paying, you will be given all the rights to share, use, modify, sell and do whatever else you want with the work. You can color sketches, rewrite stories, sell paintings printed on a shirt or whatever else you want.</p>
<p>If you want your commission to be kept secret until completion or private altogether, tell me in advance!</p>
<p>You'll get lots of work in progress updates along the way so that any mistakes can be spotted and fixed as early as possible.</p>
<p>There's no restrictions on themes other than things that are likely to get me in trouble. Not allowed are, for example, nazi-adjacent imagery, racism or underage characters. Anything that's just "weird" or "gross" is probably fine, ask about it if you're not sure.</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">Pictures</h2>

<dt>Painting</dt>
<dd>Fully rendered, lineless painting. €159.00 per character, background between €0.00 and €159.00.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Background prices depend heavily on complexity. An empty room backdrop may be free, while a landscape probably costs full price.</p>
<p>There may be other things that affect the price. For example, excess amounts of limbs may cost more, a faintly visible character may cost less.</p>
<p>Alternate versions ("alts") are allowed. If they cost extra depends on what they are, usually they're free.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Stories</h2>

<p>The price is 0.018€ (one point eight cents) per word.</p>
<p>You decide a maximum word count for your story and only have to pay to that number of words at most, even if I go over that.</p>
<p>For example, you ask for a story with a maximum of 2000 words. If I write exactly 2000 words, you pay €36.00. If I write 3000 words, you still pay only €36.00. If I only write 1500 words, then you pay €27.00.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">Animations, Games etc.</h2>

<p>I'm a software developer, so I can also make stuff that moves and is interactive. Hit me up with your ideas.</p>
<p>Price depends on the project, but probably a few hundred Euros and up. We'll discuss it and figure it out.</p>
