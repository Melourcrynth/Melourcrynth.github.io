<p>I'm taking commissions for drawing on Monday. Due to circumstance, there are restrictions on what can be drawn: <strong>macro, vore, paws, fat and such is allowed, but nothing explicit.</strong> Since they're so restricted, these commissions are a good chunk cheaper than the usual.</p>
<p>The Drawpiles happen Monday, starting around 5pm EST and I'll be drawing until I have to sleep. You should be available to look at WIPs and make change requests somewhere during that time.</p>
<p>If you want, the drawing can be streamed in a Discord call or whatever.</p>
<p>Prices are in Euros (€)! Payment via Paypal any time after completion. It doesn't need to be immediately afterwards, it can be at any later date. After paying, you can do whatever you want with the work: share it, change it, sell printed mugs, cast it across the night sky, anything.</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">Timed</h2>

<p>Also known under the unsavory term "art slave." You get to tell me to doodle, sketch, draw or paint whatever can be fit a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>This is <em>drawing time</em>, not time on the clock. That means only time spent drawing, discussions, breaks and such don't count against the time. I can nerd out over the exact measurement mechanics of this if you ask.</p>
<p>You should have 2 to 3 real hours per hour of drawing time available. Ideally you should be (mostly) around to watch it being streamed.</p>
<p>If we end up spending less than the ordered time, you only pay the minutes actually worked. If we go over, you only pay as much as you ordered.</p>
<ul>
<li>€30.00 for an hour of drawing time (<em>not</em> an hour on the clock, see above)</li>
</ul>
